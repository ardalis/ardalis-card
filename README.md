# Ardalis Calling Card

In case you ever need my information and all you have is a terminal and `npm`. [ardalis on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ardalis)

## Usage

```bash
npx ardalis
```

## Credit

Completely *borrowed* this idea from [Tierney](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang) and [ReverentGeek](https://github.com/ReverentGeek).

## First Publication

To publish to npm you'll need to do this (after installing npm):

```bash
npm adduser
```

Create and/or log in with your username.

Then:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

And within a few seconds, your card should be available to anyone with npm installed by typing `npx ardalis` (or, y'know, your package's name).
